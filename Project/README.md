## LSTM Stock Price Trend Prediction
```markdown
# 📈 Stock Price Trend Prediction with LSTM

Predict future stock prices using deep learning (LSTM) and visualize the trends with historical data and indicators.

## 🚀 Objective
To build an LSTM-based neural network that can predict stock price trends using past data. Optional: Integrate technical indicators like Moving Average and RSI.



## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **TensorFlow / Keras** (LSTM Model)
- **yFinance** (Stock Data API)
- **Matplotlib** (Plotting)
- **Scikit-learn** (Preprocessing)
- **Google Colab** (Training)
- **Streamlit** (Optional Dashboard Deployment)

## 📊 Features

- Download stock data with `yFinance`
- Normalize and preprocess data for LSTM
- Build & train a multi-layer LSTM model
- Plot actual vs predicted closing prices
- Optionally integrate:
  - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Optional Streamlit app for real-time interaction



## 🔧 How to Run

### 🔹 Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)
1. Clone or download the repo
2. Open `LSTM_Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
3. Run cells in order
4. The model will:
   - Train on historical stock data
   - Predict test data
   - Plot predictions vs actual prices

### 🔹 Streamlit Dashboard (Optional)
1. Save trained model as `lstm_model.h5`
2. Run locally:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
````

3. Or deploy it via [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)



Sure! Here's a clean **Sample Output** section you can paste directly into your `README.md`:

* The **black line** represents actual historical closing prices.
* The **green line** shows the predicted closing prices from the LSTM model.
* The model learns short-term patterns and tries to match the trend curve.




## ✅ Deliverables
