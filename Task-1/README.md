# 🧹 Data Preprocessing Pipeline in Python

This repository contains a complete data preprocessing pipeline for preparing datasets before applying machine learning models. The process includes handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical values, and removing outliers using visualization and statistical methods.



## 📂 Contents

- `data_preprocessing.py` – Python script for preprocessing workflow
- `your_dataset.csv` – (Placeholder for your dataset; replace with your file)
- `README.md` – Documentation for understanding and using the project



## 🔧 Features

✅ Import and explore dataset  
✅ Handle missing values with mean/median/imputation  
✅ Convert categorical features using encoding  
✅ Normalize/standardize numerical features  
✅ Visualize and remove outliers using boxplots and IQR method  



## 🧪 Requirements

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```



## 🚀 How to Use

1. Place your dataset in the same folder and rename it to `your_dataset.csv` or update the file path in the script.
2. Run the script using:

```bash
python data_preprocessing.py
```



## 📊 Output

- Clean, ready-to-use dataset for ML modeling
- Boxplot visualizations for each numeric feature
- Outliers removed using statistical thresholds



## 📝 Notes

- Categorical encoding can be changed to label encoding if needed.
- Imputation methods are flexible: mean, median, or forward-fill.
- Outlier removal is based on IQR (Interquartile Range), but can be adjusted.
